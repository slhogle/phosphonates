### DESCRIPTION
20/01/2019

Lots of reads from GORG pelagibacter were mapping with best hits to
some taxonomically unrelated MAGS assembled from Tully 2017 and 
Tully 2018. My first suspicion was that the GORG SAGs were 
contaminated so I searched all genes flanking PEPM on the same 
scaffold against MARMICRODB to try and see if there were taxonomic 
inconsistencies. This is the `check_tax_pepm_scaffolds`
directory There were some, but my throught now is that a number 
of the PEPM contigs in the Tara MAGS from non-pelagibacter actually 
do come from pelagibacter and were binned erroneously. I am more 
inclined to trust GORG SAGS than unsupervised binned MAGS.


I think these PEPM sequences are likely from pelagibacterales...
